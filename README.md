# Black-Box-Modeling-Using-Adaptive-Neuro-Fuzzy-Inference-System
An electrochemical system is a subset of mechatronic systems which includes a wide range of batteries, such as nickel–cadmium, lead–acid 
batteries, and lithium-ion. These systems have many nonlinear behaviors and uncertainties in their operating range. Computational intelligence approaches
are more accurate and quick than conventional analytical methods for estimating and analyzing nonlinear systems. In thispaper, an Adaptive 
Neuro Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model as a black box method to identify dynamic behaviors of a lithium-ion is presented. The purposed
of modeling is presentation and analysis a computational intelligence approach to estimate and identify secondary cells or rechargeable 
batteries. In this study, a real dataset as database for exponential modeling
is used. This dataset relates to a comprehensive test on li-ion
batteries that was set up by researchers in NASA Ames Research
Center. The presented model contains an ANFIS model using
grid partition with three signals; load voltage, measured voltage
and temperature of the battery. The results illustrate that the
presented approach gives rather good error minimization and
convergence to identify of the li-ion battery. In addition, this
approach can be used to identify other storage batteries or other
similar nonlinear systems.
